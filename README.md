# Gauss Sum Strong Simulation v.0.1

Universal quantum circuits can be formulated in the Pauli measurement-based formalism as input T gate magic states, Clifford gates, and then multi-Pauli measurements. This code simulates single-Pauli measurements to show some theoretical bounds on the cost of full multi-Pauli measurements.
